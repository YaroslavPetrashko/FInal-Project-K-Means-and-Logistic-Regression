# E. coli Protein Localization Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes E. coli protein localization patterns using machine learning techniques:
- Logistic Regression for classification of protein localization sites
- Feature importance analysis and visualization
- Cross-validation for model optimization

## Dataset
- 336 E. coli protein sequences
- 7 predictive features (signal sequences and amino acid properties)
- 8 localization classes
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Key Results
- Identified most important features for localization prediction
- Optimized model parameters through grid search


## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `kmeans_and_logistic.ipynb`
